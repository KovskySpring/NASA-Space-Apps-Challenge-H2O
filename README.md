# NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge-H2O

## Summary

Nowadays, it is tough for farmers to thrive in their industry due to volatile climate conditions. Farmers require comprehensible data to decide their agricultural practices, and NASA provides remote sensing Earth Observation data. But there needs to be a bridge to connect the two worlds. This is where we come in. For our project, we created a Web App that assists farmers in optimizing their yield by estimating the condition of crops. First, farmers can input a crop type and select a region on the map where it is intended. Then, they will receive the approximate yield for a given crop in that region and make an educated plan on whether it is appropriate to plant the crop without having to do all the elaborate calculations. To ensure the information they receive is accurate, we use data provided by NASA and trusted organizations to analyze the suitability of the crop as a backend while leaving the frontend user-friendly for farmers. The end goal is to increase farmerâ€™s efficiency and productivity.
